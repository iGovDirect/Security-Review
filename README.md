# Security Review

## What is it we want to achieve?

The system will never be able to claim that is secure against every threat. Instead, the systems goal is to collect votes on proposals and store the records in a files that can be counted by anybody. When each file is created - a SHA 3 hash is generated and injected into the bitcoin blockchain. This way the file records can be downloaded and audited by the voters.


### What is the goal of the security review?

By letting security experts review code and libraries used we can harden the system. By implemening best practice policies we lower the risk of threats.
